# Refactor-SEO

## What I achieved in homework assignment
I viewed the source code
I found semantics HTML elements
I used certain styling and positioning that made 
the website easier for anyone to get the information
that they are looking for.
I made the "Search Engine Optimization" on header
accessible for people to click on and will take them
to the information they are looking for\
I changed the heading font sizes bigger and easier to see
I added alt attributes for all the images so people understand incase images do not want to appear.
Finally I changed the title element to a desciptive title.
